# Quantum_Algorithms_for_Solving_Optimization_Problems
• Implemented approaches based on quantum algorithms (QAOA, Grover, VQE, etc) to solve Max-Cut problem, stable-set problem, and lights out problem.

• Classical approach was also included, both for demonstration and comparing with the quantum method(ex: the time-complexity).
